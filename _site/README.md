### Registration:<a name="register"></a>

Effective operation of any network requires the administrators and operators to perform at their peak. To do this, we must enure we can provide the best services possible to those in the network. Unfortunately, we are closed to registration for now. This is likely to change after a while, when everything is in order and we have the network infrastructure to maintain it.
